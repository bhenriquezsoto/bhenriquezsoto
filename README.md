I'm Benjamin, a Mathematical and Computational Engineering Student from Santiago, Chile. I am primarily interested in the intersection between robotics and computer vision â€” especially planning and SLAM. My work is grounded in the fundamentals of physics and mathematics, and I enjoy tackling problems that combine rigorous theory with realâ€‘world applications.

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching series, doing exercise, seeing Lex Fridman podcasts and learning new things.

So, if you are interested in collaborating on a project, discussing a topic, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!

#### Let's connect! ðŸš€
